        <p className="text-cream py-4 max-w-[700px] text-sm sm:text-base">After recently graduating from University of West London with a Masters in Electronic Music Composition where I dedicated my practice to analysing brain activity whilst listening to sound design pieces and compositions I had created from my home studio, the natural step was to learn software development. I enrolled onto General Assemblyâ€™s remote software engineering course part-time to learn the fundamentals in programming and applied the learning by creating four projects. I am looking for my first role in the industry as a Junior Software Developer where I can leverage the skills and experience gained so far with my passion for developing software.</p>
